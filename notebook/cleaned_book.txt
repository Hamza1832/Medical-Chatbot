THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS A tumor that starts in the brain is a primary brain tumor. Glioblastoma multiforme, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma are examples of primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors are grouped into benign tumors and malignant tumors. Benign brain tumors A benign brain tumor consists of very slow- growing cells, usually has distinct borders and rarely spreads. When viewed under a microscope, these cells have an almost normal appearance. Surgery alone might be an effective treatment for this type of tumor. A brain tumor composed of benign cells, but located in a vital area, can be considered life-threatening – although the tumor and its cells would not be classified as malignant. Malignant brain tumors A malignant brain tumor is usually rapid- growing, invasive and life-threatening. Malignant brain tumors are sometimes called brain cancer. However, since primary brain tumors rarely spread outside the brain and spinal cord, they do not exactly fit the general definition of cancer. Cancer is a disease defined by: • Unregulated growth of abnormal cells • Abnormal cells that grow into or around parts of the body and interfere with their normal functioning • Spread to distant organs in the body Brain tumors can be called malignant if they: • Have the characteristics of cancer cells • Are located in a critical part of the brain • Are causing life threatening damage Malignant brain tumors that are cancerous can spread within the brain and spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body . They lack distinct borders due to their tendency to send “roots” into nearby normal tissue. They can also shed cells that travel to distant parts of the brain and spine by way of the cerebrospinal fluid. Some malignant tumors, however, do remain localized to a region of the brain or spinal cord. Benign Tumors • Slow growing • Distinct borders • Rarely spread Malignant Tumors • Usually rapid growing • Invasive • Life threatening METASTATIC BRAIN TUMORS Cancer cells that begin growing elsewhere in the body and then travel to the brain form metastatic brain tumors. For example, cancers of the lung, breast, colon and skin (melanoma) frequently spread to the brain via the bloodstream or a magnetic-like attraction to other organs of the body . All metastatic brain tumors are, by definition, malignant and can truly be called “brain cancer.” TUMOR NAMES T umors are diagnosed, and then named, based on a classification system. Most medical centers now use the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for this purpose. TUMOR GRADING T umors are graded to facilitate communication, plan treatment and predict outcomes. The grade of a tumor indicates its degree of malignancy . Using the WHO grading system, grade I tumors are the least malignant and are usually associated with long-term survival. The tumors grow slowly and have an almost normal appearance when viewed through a microscope. Surgery alone might be an effective treatment for this grade of tumor.

The brain is a soft mass of supportive tissues and nerve cells connected to the spinal cord. Nerves in the brain and spinal cord transmit messages throughout the body . The brain and spinal cord together form the central nervous system (CNS). The central nervous system is the core of our existence. It controls our personality – thoughts, memory , intelligence, speech, understanding and emotions; our senses – vision, hearing, taste, smell and touch; our basic body functions – breathing, heart beat and blood pressure; and how we function in our environment – movement, balance and coordination. Learning about the normal workings of the brain and spine will help you understand the symptoms of brain tumors, how they are diagnosed and how they are treated.

Generally , the first step in the treatment of an anaplastic astrocytoma is surgery . The goals of surgery are to obtain tumor tissue for diagnosis and treatment planning, to remove as much tumor as possible and to reduce the symptoms caused by the presence of the tumor. There are some circumstances, such as certain medical conditions or concerns about the location of the tumor, in which a biopsy may be done in place of surgery . The tissue obtained during the biopsy is then used to confirm the diagnosis. Because the tentacle-like cells of an astrocytoma grow into the surrounding tissue, these tumors cannot be totally removed during surgery . Partial removal can help decrease symptoms; the tissue obtained during that surgery confirms the type of tumor. Radiation is then used to treat the remaining tumor. In general, the standard approach is external beam radiation directed to the area of tumor and a margin around it. Specialized delivery , such as the use of conformal radiation or intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) may be recommended. Although not standard treatment, there are other forms of radiation therapy available – focused or stereotactic radiosurgery , implanted radiation and proton therapy – which may be recommended to you. Your radiation oncologist will decide which form of radiation therapy is best for your particular tumor. Chemotherapy , most often with the drug temozolomide, may be recommended immediately after radiation or when the tumor recurs. Some treatment plans may still use the drugs BCNU, CCNU, procarbazine or cisplatin. In addition, there are also many new drugs being tested in clinical studies (trials). Some physicians may choose not to use chemotherapy for the initial tumor, “reserving” it for re-growth if necessary . Anaplastic astrocytomas tend to recur and when they do, they may re-grow as a grade III or a grade IV tumor. Treatment is based on the grade of tumor at recurrence and location. For information on astrocytoma grade IV , see “Glioblastoma” on .BRAIN STEM GlIOMA Brain stem gliomas arise in or on the brain stem – the area containing all of the converging connections from the brain to the spinal cord as well as important structures involved in eye movements, face and throat muscle control, breathing and heart rate and sensation. Between   and  % of brain tumors in children are brain stem gliomas. This tumor most often affects children between   and   years old, but can also be found in adults generally between   and   years old. Most of these tumors are astrocytomas which vary from localized grade I tumors (mostly in children) to infiltrating grade II or III tumors. However, many are never biopsied due to the high-risk of performing any surgical procedure in that area, which makes determination of grade impossible. In these situations, the diagnosis can usually be based on the MRI scan features. Most of these tumors are classified by their location: Cancer is a disease defined by: • Upper brain stem (midbrain or tectum) • Middle brain stem (pons) • Lower brain stem (cervico-medullary) and by MRI appearance: • Localized (circumscribed or in one contained location) • Diffusely infiltrating (tumor spread within the area) • Exophytic (meaning the tumor has a knob protruding outside of the brainstem) The majority of brain stem tumors occur in the pons and are diffusely infiltrating, therefore precluding the tumor’s surgical removal. A few of these tumors are localized and may be reachable for resection. These tumors tend to be very slow growing, not located in the pons and exophytic. CHAPTER  : TYPES Of BRAIN TUMORS EPENDYMOMA Recent studies show that ependymomas may originate from ependymal cells (which line the ventricles of the brain and the center of the spinal cord) or from radial glial cells (cells related to early development of the brain). These are relatively rare tumors, accounting for  – % of all primary tumors and  - % of all gliomas. They represent about  % of childhood brain tumors. Ependymomas are soft, greyish or red tumors which may contain cysts or mineral calcifications. They are divided into four major types: subependymomas (grade I), myxopapillary ependymomas and ependymomas (grade II) and anaplastic ependymomas (grade III). The grade is based on how much the cells look like normal ependymal cells, although various grading systems exist. The cells of a grade I tumor look somewhat unusual, whereas grade IV tumor cells look definitely abnormal. Subependymomas usually occur near a ventricle. Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to occur in the lower part of the spinal column. Both of these ependymoma types are slow growing and are considered to be low-grade or grade I tumors. Ependymomas are the conventional type, lowgrade (grade   and II) tumors. These tumors are usually located along, within or adjacent to the ventricular system, often in the posterior fossa or in the spinal cord. Based on the appearance of the cell patterns when viewed under a microscope, this group of tumors can be sub-divided into smaller groups based on the appearance of their cell patterns: cellular ependymomas, papillary ependymoma, clear cell ependymoma a nd tancytic ependymoma. There are several other patterns as well, but regardless of appearance, these are all considered grade II tumors. Anaplastic ependymomas are high-grade tumors (grade III) and tend to be faster growing than the low-grade tumors. These are most commonly found in the brain in adults and specifically in the posterior fossa in children. They are rarely found in the spinal cord. The first step in the treatment of an ependymoma is surgery to remove as much tumor as possible. The amount of tumor that can be removed, however, depends on the location of the tumor. Radiation therapy is usually recommended for older children and adults following surgery if all visible tumor wasn’t removed and in some cases even after complete resection. If the tumor is localized, radiation therapy is usually given just to that area of the brain. If the tumor has spread, radiation is usually given to the entire brain and spine, with an extra amount of radiation (called a “boost”) given to the area of the brain where the tumor started. In general, the role of chemotherapy in treating newly diagnosed ependymomas is not clear. However, chemotherapy may be used to treat tumors that have grown back after radiation therapy or to delay radiation therapy in infants and very young children. GERM CEll TUMORS These uncommon tumors represent  – % of childhood brain tumors and occur primarily in young people between the ages of   and  . Germ cell tumors arise in the pineal or suprasellar regions of the brain. Included in this type of tumor are the germinoma, the teratoma, the more aggressive embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumors and the choriocarcinoma. Mixed germ cell tumors also exist. Because all of these tumors tend to spread via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), diagnosis includes evaluation of the entire brain and spinal EPENDYMOMA Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the center of the spinal cord. CHAPTER  : TYPES Of BRAIN TUMORS be resistant. For this reason, the treatment plan for glioblastoma will combine several approaches. The first step in treating a glioblastoma is surgery to make a diagnosis, relieve pressure and safely remove as much tumor as possible. Because these tumor cells have octopus-like tentacles, there are no clear edges to glioblastomas. This feature makes them very difficult to remove completely . If the tumor is located near important structures such as the language center or motor area, the ability to remove most of the tumor may be further limited. Radiation therapy , accompanied by chemotherapy , almost always follows surgery or biopsy . Radiation therapy affects mostly replicating cells and therefore causes more damage to tumor cells than to normal brain cells (most cells in the brain are not actively dividing). The most common type of radiation is called fractionated external beam radiation, meaning that the radiation is given in several treatments over a few weeks. (This is also called standard radiation or conventional radiation.) It is given to the tumor and a margin around it, but not to the whole brain. Another type of radiation sometimes used for glioblastomas is conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Other types of radiation may be used on an experimental basis but are not considered “standard” therapies (for example brachytherapy , which consists of either implanted radioactive seeds or catheters with temporary radioactive sources in the tumor or monoclonal antibodies tagged with radioactive particles). Because of its very focused beams and the need to radiate some amount of tissue around the central mass of a glioblastoma, stereotactic radiosurgery is generally not used for this tumor. The exception may be in treating a tumor with a very specific, localized area of growth or regrowth. In that situation, radiosurgery may be used as a “boost” to that very confined area; however this also is a strategy that is not widely used.The most commonly used chemotherapy drug in adults is currently temozolomide; however, other drugs are also being tested. Many of the studies combine temozolomide with other drugs which have different biological actions, such as those affecting blood vessel growth or drugs which interfere with proteins created by the tumor. Some neurosurgeons use biodegradable wafers which contain the chemotherapy drug BCNU. The wafers are placed in the cavity created during tumor removal. Other new delivery systems which place drug directly into the tumor area are under investigation as well. Chemotherapy might also be used to delay radiation in young children. Because glioblastoma cells tend to move into nearby tissue, total removal of these tumors is not possible. T umor regrowth can be treated with additional surgery , another form of focused radiation, a different chemotherapy drug or combination of drugs or any number of new approaches to these tumors. An area of active research interest is the development of drugs that target specific biological abnormalities found in the tumor cells. Many of these drugs interfere with or block signaling pathways within the tumor – the message patterns tumors and their byproducts (such as proteins or enzymes) create. The ability to identify these biologic differences and to create drugs that target these differences, are called “personalized” or “individualized” medicine. While this is an exciting area of science, development and testing of these drugs are in the earliest stages. Immunotherapy – the use of vaccines or immunizations – is another area of research interest. These therapies use the body’s own immune system to fight a tumor. There are several research studies focusing on this area of treatment and many of these studies are open to those with a glioblastoma. Some of these treatments use tumor cells, removed at the time of surgery , which are treated in a laboratory then re-injected CHAPTER  : TYPES Of BRAIN TUMORS MEDUllOBlASTOMA Medulloblastomas represent about  % of the brain tumors in children under the age of  . In addition, medulloblastomas represent about  % of the brain tumors in adults. Medulloblastomas are always located in the cerebellum. Medulloblastoma is a fast-growing, high-grade tumor which frequently spreads to other parts of the central nervous system. Given its location – close to one of the fluid cavities of the brain called the fourth ventricle – the tumor may also extend into that cavity and block the cerebrospinal fluid circulation or send tumor cells through the spinal fluid to the spine. It is uncommon for medulloblastomas to spread outside the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms of medulloblastoma, particularly in young children, include behavioral changes; symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as headaches, nausea, vomiting and drowsiness; gait unbalance and poor coordination of the limbs; and unusual eye movements. Treatment consists of surgical removal of as much tumor as possible, radiation and chemotherapy . Testing will also be done to check for possible tumor spread, including an MRI of the spine and a cerebrospinal fluid analysis. For older children, adults without evidence of the tumor spreading and those for whom most of the tumor has been removed, radiation to the tumor area followed by a lower dose of radiation to the entire brain and spinal cord follows surgery . Very young children are often treated with chemotherapy instead of radiation to defer its use until they are older. Chemotherapy generally follows radiation therapy . The most commonly used agents include a combination of cisplatin and vincristine with either cyclophosphamide or CCNU. Other drugs, such as etoposide, have also shown activity against the tumor. There is no standard treatment for recurrent tumors. Some patients with a recurrent tumor, who show good response to chemotherapy , may benefit from high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant. New therapies and new treatment plans are developed in organized programs called clinical trials (see “Clinical Trials” on ). METASTATIC BRAIN TUMORS A metastatic or secondary , brain tumor is formed by cancer cells from a primary cancer elsewhere in the body which spread to the brain. In most situations, the primary cancer is diagnosed before it spreads to the brain, but in some circumstances the brain tumors are found the same time or before the primary cancer is found. Cancers that frequently spread to the brain include: • Lung cancer • Breast cancer • Melanoma (malignant skin cancer) • Kidney cancer • Colon cancer MENINGIOMA These tumors arise from the “arachnoid mater” – one of the layers of the meninges (the lining of the brain). Meningiomas represent about  % of all primary brain tumors and occur most frequently in middle-aged women. The majority lOCATION Of THE CEREBEllUM Cerebellum Ponsfourth Ventricle Medulla Oblongata Spine CHAPTER  : TYPES Of BRAIN TUMORS of the tumor. Radiation therapy or radiosurgery might be of value if the tumor is not entirely removed. For some patients, surgery may not be recommended. For those with no symptoms (when they have been diagnosed coincidentally), those with minor symptoms of long duration and those for whom surgery would be risky , long-term close observation with scans may be advised. An alternative includes focused radiation, also called “stereotactic radiosurgery .” The atypical meningioma (grade II) has a middle range of behavior. These tumors are not clearly malignant but they may invade the brain, have a tendency to recur and are faster-growing. The diagnosis and grade are determined by specific features that can be seen under the microscope. Radiation therapy is indicated after surgery , particularly if any residual tumor is present. Anaplastic or malignant meningiomas (grade III) and papillary meningiomas are malignant and tend to invade adjacent brain tissue. They represent less than  % of meningiomas. Radiation therapy is clearly indicated following surgery regardless of whether residual tumor is present. Meningiomas may recur, either as a slow-growing tumor or sometimes as a more rapid-growing, higher-grade tumor. Recurrent tumors are treated similarly , with surgery followed by either standard radiation therapy or radiosurgery regardless of the grade of the meningioma. Chemotherapy and biological agents are being studied for recurrent meningioma. Drugs that target abnormal signaling pathways within the tumor are also being evaluated. Hormone therapy does not appear effective. MIXED GlIOMA Mixed gliomas commonly contain a high proportion of more than one type of cell. Most often these tumors contain both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – these tumors are generally called mixed gliomas or oligoastrocytoma. Occasionally , ependymal cells are also found. The behavior of a mixed glioma tumor tends to be based on the grade of the tumor. It is less clear whether the tumor behavior is closer to that of the most abundant cell type. Standard treatment for a mixed glioma is similar to that for an astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma of the same grade. The treatment plan may include surgery followed by radiation therapy , particularly if the tumor is high-grade (grade III or IV) although it may also be indicated for lower-grade tumors (grade II). Chemotherapy will generally be used in high-grade tumors. OlIGODENDROGlIOMA These tumors arise from oligodendrocytes, one of the types of cells that make up the supportive or glial, tissue of the brain. Under the microscope these tumor cells seem to have “short arms” or a fried-egg shape as opposed to astrocytomas, which have “long arms” or a star-like shape. Oligodendrogliomas can be low-grade (grade II) or high-grade (grade III also called anaplastic). Sometimes oligodendrogliomas may be mixed with other cell types. These tumors may also be graded using an “A to D” system which is based on microscopic features such as the appearance of the cell nucleus, the number of blood vessels and presence or absence of dead tissue called necrosis. The grade denotes the speed with which the tumor cells reproduce and the aggressiveness of the tumor. Oligodendrogliomas occur most frequently in young and middle-aged adults, but can also be found in children. The most common location is the cerebral hemisphere, with about half of those tumors being found in the frontal lobe. Seizure is OlIGODENDROCYTE Oligodendrocytes are one of the types of cells that make up the supportive, or glial, tissue of the brain.

THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  INTRODUCTION Causes and risk factors can be environmental , such as being exposed to poisonous substances in the home or at work; eating or not eating certain foods; or whether or not we exercise, smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. They can also be genetic , such as being born with a gene mutation or susceptibility that one inherits from parents. These genetic mutations/susceptibilities may also accumulate over time, as one grows older. Unfortunately , no risk factor accounting for the majority of brain tumors has been identified, even though many environmental and genetic factors have been and are currently being studied. ENVIRONMENTAl f ACTORS Many studies have looked at a wide spectrum of environmental factors as possible causes of brain tumors including but not limited to: • Being exposed to air pollution, residential power lines, second hand smoke, agricultural chemicals and industrial formaldehyde • Working in synthetic rubber manufacturing or petroleum refining/production • Smoking cigarettes, smoking cigarettes while pregnant and consuming alcohol • Using common medications like birth control pills, sleeping pills, headache remedies, over-the-counter pain treatments and antihistamines • Having a history of head trauma, epilepsy , seizures or convulsions • Experiencing viruses and common infections • Consuming cured foods (nitrites) These exposures are difficult to accurately measure and can lead to inconsistencies across studies, making the results difficult to validate. Additional long-term research on these factors is needed before definite conclusions can be formed. Of the long list of factors studied, only exposure to ionizing radiation has been consistently associated with an increased risk for developing a brain tumor. (Ionizing radiation uses “high-frequency” energy waves such as X-rays or gamma rays. However, radiation doses used today for medical and dental therapies are better focused than those used in medicine decades ago.) On the other hand, some studies have shown that a history of allergies as an adult, eating fruits and vegetables as a child and having a mother who ate fruits and vegetables during pregnancy and having chicken pox as a child puts one at a decreased risk of development of brain tumors. Of particular interest over the last decade has been the potential association between cell phone use and risk of developing a brain tumor. Multiple large studies have been performed in both the United States and Europe. Some have shown an association between cell phone use and brain tumor risk, while other studies show no association. In addition, studies have also investigated the difference in risk of a brain tumor between short-term and long-term (>  years) cell phone use with further conflicting results. In general, the conclusions from most of these studies are ( ) there is no consistent association between cell phone use and risk of developing a brain tumor (benign or malignant) and ( ) there is a very slight increased risk of a brain tumor associated with using a cell phone for   years or more. Further studies, in both the laboratory and in humans with longer follow up, are needed to fully understand this exposure and any potential relationship with brain tumor development. Additional research is needed before definite conclusions can be formed. ABOUT ClUSTERS Of BRAIN TUMORS Understandably , communities become concerned when several individuals within a neighborhood are diagnosed with brain tumors. Scientists studying these groups will want to learn whether these are metastatic brain tumors (those that CHAPTER  : CAUSES AND RISK fACTORS • Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play a role in making sure that the cell goes through its growth cycle normally . • DNA repair genes make proteins that control accurate repair of damaged DNA. • Carcinogen metabolizing genes make proteins that break down toxic chemicals in the body that could cause damage to one’s DNA, like the chemicals in cigarette smoke and/or alcohol. • Immune response genes make proteins that control how one’s immune system responds to viruses and infections. With the publication of the Human Genome and advances in genotyping technology , scientists can now identify over a million genetic variants found in the human body and ask the question: “Are any of these inherited genetic variants associated with risk of a brain tumor?” This type of study is called a genome-wide association (GWA) study . T wo recent GWA studies of glioma found some results in common, but they also found some differing results. The scientists involved in these studies believe the differences in their results may be due to the differences in the people who were part of their studies. This research shows that common genetic differences amongst the population can contribute to risk for developing a malignant brain tumor. Much more investigation is needed to fully understand the importance of these variations and how they may impact brain tumor risk. This type of GWA study has yet to be performed for benign brain tumors or pediatric brain tumors. “Acquired” or “somatic” means genetic changes that have accumulated over time. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project Studies of any specific gene are complicated by the fact that there are many potential genes in the human genome to consider. While these genes interact with one another, they may also interact with environmental factors as well. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project, funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), has a goal of completely cataloging all of the somatic genetic changes in more than   different cancers, then making these data publically available in order to improve the ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. TCGA started as a pilot project in 2006 prioritizing glioblastoma (GBM), ovarian and lung cancers as the first cancers to study . The first GBM paper published under this project showed three biological pathways involved with GBM. Since that publication, other scientists have described additional key genetic changes associated with malignant brain tumors. Some of these reports include important comparisons with low grade gliomas and other glioma subtypes. TCGA is now expanding its efforts to include other types and grades of gliomas. Chromosome Changes Another area of scientific study is the ability tumors have to lose or gain pieces of chromosomes . Each normal cell in any human body has   pairs of chromosomes. The most common chromosomal changes in brain tumors occur on chromosomes  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . Changes on chromosomes   and   are most frequently found in oligodendrogliomas. Changes on chromosome   are most frequently found in meningiomas. Scientists are studying how this information can best be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes. CHAPTER  : CAUSES AND RISK fACTORS   www.abta.orgChapter  : Symptoms and Side Effects The symptoms of a brain tumor are different in each person. While it is not possible to know exactly what symptoms to expect, understanding what might occur – and why – may help you better prepare for these possibilities. Symptoms like memory problems, seizures, or changes in personality or in speech may be indications of a brain tumor. In some cases, tumors are discovered by accident, such as when a scan is performed for a non-brain tumor purpose, such as a head injury . It is possible that the tumor may not cause any symptoms that interfere with the normal workings of the body or the symptoms were so minimal that you were not aware of the tumor until a scan was done. CHAPTER  : SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EffECTS emotional changes. Sexual development may be delayed or advanced or sexual desire may change. Thalamic Tumors may cause sensory changes on one side of the body . Tremors during purposeful movement may be noticed. Posterior Fossa Tumors (such as choroid plexus, fourth ventricle and cerebellar tumors) may cause tremors or a clumsy , uncoordinated pattern when walking. Nerve irritation may cause pain in the base of the head. EMOTIONAl EffECTS When a brain tumor is diagnosed, it can take away your sense of security and control. This can be both unsettling and frightening. Uncertainty is among the most challenging things that you will have to grapple with on a day-to-day basis. The feeling that your body has betrayed you often leads to a rollercoaster of potent emotions. Patients with a brain tumor often develop symptoms due to the stress of diagnosis and treatment. Decreased appetite, depression, irritability , fatigue, sleeplessness, temporary memory problems and restlessness are common. Nausea (a sick-to-your-stomach feeling), bladder problems or constipation also may occur. Your doctor usually can help you deal with these problems. There is no “right” way for you to behave or feel when you have been given a brain tumor diagnosis. Dealing with changes to your appearance – such as shedding your hair or losing weight – and losing your one-time sense of invulnerability is difficult for the best of us. It’s important to recognize the emotional effects of cancer and find ways to cope. It may help to know that it is completely normal to feel a range of emotions when your life suddenly changes. Some people find that just having a loved one to talk to when days are difficult is enough. Others need some extra professional help, perhaps a caring member of your health care team, a social worker or a clinical psychologist. Support groups and relaxation exercises may also be useful. For information on coping strategies and tips on managing stress, see Chapter  , “Coping,” on . PHYSICAl EffECTS Treating a brain tumor takes a physical toll on one’s body . As you go through your treatment, know the potential side effects, such as hair loss or changes in your body . While the effects are different for every person, a brain tumor and subsequent treatment can change a person’s appearance, as well as their ability to carry on a full, active day . Many hospitals offer make-up and hair sessions for those who have received cancer treatment. These seminars provide personal appearance tips and can help boost self-confidence. Additionally , a listing of wig and head covering resources is available through the ABTA. Oftentimes, when you think you look your best, you feel better about yourself. People with a brain tumor often have questions about sex: “Can I still have sex? How soon after surgery can I have sex? Will my treatments affect my desire for sex?” Talk to a member of your health care team – they can answer your questions and provide suggestions. Your desire for sex may decrease temporarily because you may feel fatigued, unattractive or you may fear hurting yourself. Or, your partner may be overly cautious and afraid of hurting you. For the time being, consider replacing sexual activity with non-sexual physical closeness such as holding hands, cuddling, kissing or hugging. Find activities you can comfortably share and special times to be alone. Be realistic during your treatment – keeping up with your usual responsibilities may be too difficult. Medications, treatment and travel to and from treatment, can all cause fatigue. Set priorities. Do only what has to be done and if you still have CHAPTER  : SYMPTOMS AND SIDE EffECTS   www.abta.orgChapter  : Diagnosis Sometimes a brain tumor is found by accident – it may be seen on a scan performed for a non-brain tumor purpose – but most commonly , a tumor makes its presence known by interfering with the normal workings of the body . Follow-up care for a brain tumor extends over a lifetime, not unlike many other medical conditions. At some point, depending on the type of tumor, your brain tumor may become a “chronic illness” just as heart disease or diabetes are “chronic” conditions. Understanding your tests – what they are, how they work and what they can or cannot show – can help you feel more comfortable and in control. If at any time you have questions about the tests ordered for you, feel free to ask. Your nurses and the professionals giving these tests can provide answers, fact sheets, helpful instructions and the reassurance you need to feel comfortable. CHAPTER  : DIAGNOSIS abnormalities. Recent studies on the radiation exposure caused during CT scans are helping doctors to redefine when a CT scan versus another type of scan is most appropriate. MRI Scan The MRI is a tunnel-shaped piece of equipment. Some pictures are taken before the contrast injection. If contrast is used, it will be injected prior to the completion of the scan. The patient lies on a table that slides into the tunnel. Inside the scanner, a magnetic field surrounds the head and a radio frequency pulse is introduced to the area. No X-rays are used. The magnetic field causes atoms in the brain to change direction. The radio frequency pulse causes another change of direction. When the pulse stops, the atoms relax and return to their original position. During relaxation, the atoms give off energy in differing amounts and at different intervals of time. Antennas pick up these signals and feed them into a computer, which assembles a picture. Because different atoms have their own characteristic radio signals, the computer can distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue. Patients with some cardiac monitors, pacemakers or some types of surgical clips cannot undergo MRI scanning because of the magnetic fields. For those who are claustrophobic, sedation or open MRI scanners may be an option. There are several different types of MRIs now available. Some of these are commonly used (such as fast MRI) while others are still being developed (such as diffusion tensor imaging). An MRI offers images with excellent anatomical detail that provides clarity of the small structures in the brain, but the images often lack quantitative or finely measurable, information. Because of this lack of very fine measurable detail, it can take a while before the effectiveness of drug therapies can be imaged. Researchers are working toward new scanning techniques that will more rapidly image treatment effects. MRI SCAN This MRI scan shows an ependy - moma.

Scan courtesy of Dr. Raymand Sawaya TUMOR TUMOR TUMOR CHAPTER  : DIAGNOSIS PET (Positron Emission Tomography) Positron Emission Tomography scans are not yet routinely used for diagnosis but they can complement CT or MRI information by suggesting tumor grade. They are also used to distinguish between tumor regrowth, cells killed by radiation (necrosis) and scar tissue. Unlike CT or MRI scans, PET scans are quantitative (measurable). However, PET scans do not provide detailed images of the brain anatomy . To add anatomic detail, the latest PET scanners are being combined with CT or MRI scanners. In these hybrid scanners, PET and CT scans are acquired concurrently and the resulting PET image is fused with the CT image. The use of PET in brain tumor studies is increasing as scientists develop new imaging drugs, smaller and more mobile PET facilities and as PET scanning is combined with other types of scans. In a PET scan, a low-dose of a radioactive substance is injected into the patient. The PET scanner has a circular detector into which the patient’s head or body is moved to detect the amount of the radioactive substance taken up by various parts of the brain. The most commonly used radioactive substance for tumor imaging is a radioactive sugar (FDG). The FDG has been most commonly used because a growing tumor consumes sugar at a high rate; radiation necrosis or scar tissue consumes almost no sugar. However, the normal brain itself consumes a lot of sugar (as we think, our brain uses sugar as fuel) causing considerable background color in the PET images. Other radioactive substances now in the early phases of clinical development may provide a clearer picture of the tumor as well as the ability to capture additional details about the tumor or the activity of the tumor cells. In PET, measurements of brain or brain tumor activity (determined by concentrations of the radioactive substance) are fed into a computer, which produces a color-coded moving picture of the brain as it accumulates the radioactive sugar or drug. The use of PET had been somewhat limited because the equipment is expensive and requires radioactive materials (drugs) synthesized on-site. As new radioactive substances become available, an increasing number of facilities now offer or can arrange PET scanning. Truck-mounted mobile PET and combination PET/CT scanners are also bringing this technology into the community . SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography) Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography is not routinely used in the initial diagnosis of a brain tumor, but might complement information obtained from other scans. A SPECT scan is similar to PET. Radioactive tagged materials taken up by the brain are used. A special camera measures the rate of emission of the material as it moves through the brain. Images are generated from that information. After MRI or CT, this test might be helpful in distinguishing between low-grade and high-grade tumors or between recurrent tumor and necrosis. MEG (Magnetoencephalography) A MEG scan measures the magnetic fields created by nerve cells as they produce the small electrical currents used for neurotransmission. No physical contact is required to record the signals. The images created help scientists identify the way the parts of the brain interact with each other, how the brain processes information and the pathways followed by information as it enters the brain. This may also help us understand why certain brain tumors, based on their location, cause specific functional problems. The device looks like an old-fashioned hair dryer. When the patient moves, a computer-generated image shows which brain area is responsible for directing the motion. The MEG images are used in combination with information from other types of scans to determine the function of specific areas of the brain. MEG scanning is available at a very limited number of facilities. As government support for the development of this technique increases, community access may also increase. CHAPTER  : DIAGNOSIS and obtain pre-operative information for spinal tumor surgery . Spinal MRI has replaced myelography for many conditions. Evoked-Potentials Evoked-potential testing uses small electrodes to measure the electrical activity of a nerve. This test is particularly useful in detecting a vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Evoked-potentials can also be used to monitor neurological function during the surgical removal of a tumor. Audiometry This hearing test is useful in the diagnosis of a cerebellopontine angle tumor such as the vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Endocrine Evaluation Measurements of hormone levels in samples of blood and urine are used, along with scans, to diagnose a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor. Permietry This technique measures the size of visual fields. The information obtained might be useful in diagnosing a tumor in the area of the optic chiasm, such as a pituitary tumor. BIOPSY A biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small amount of tumor tissue is removed. The neurosurgeon submits the tumor tissue to a pathologist for study and analysis. Only then is a tissue diagnosis possible. A biopsy can be performed as part of the surgery to remove the tumor or as a separate diagnostic procedure. For areas considered inoperable, the surgeon is often able to perform a needle biopsy through a small hole drilled into the skull called a burr hole. A narrow , hollow needle is inserted through the burr hole and tumor tissue is removed from the core of the needle. Stereotaxic biopsy is a computer directed needle biopsy . The computer, using information from a CT or MRI scan, provides precise information about a tumor’s location and its position relative to the many structures in the brain. Stereotactically- guided equipment might be moved into the burr hole to remove a sample of the tumor. This is called a closed biopsy . When a biopsy is not performed, diagnosis relies solely on the interpretation of other test results. TUMOR STAGING Staging determines if a tumor has spread beyond the site of its origin. In cancers such as breast, colon or prostate this is primarily accomplished by a pathologist’s examination of nearby tissue such as lymph nodes. In those cancers, staging is a basic part of the diagnostic work-up. Staging for central nervous system (CNS) tumors is usually inferred from CT scan or MRI images or by examining the cerebrospinal fluid. Scans taken after surgery are used to determine if there is remaining tumor.

Depending on the type of tumor, your doctor may suggest MRIs every   months,   months or perhaps yearly . The follow-up should continue even   or more years after treatment. Very late recurrences can happen. A doctor who knows your history can determine if new symptoms are related to the tumor or to another medical condition. Scans help to measure the effectiveness of the treatment and monitor for possible recurrence. Other tests help evaluate the effectiveness of medications, such as antiepileptic (anti-seizure) drugs. Your doctor will tell you when your next scans or tests should be done. If you don’t have this information, call your doctor’s office and ask. Your follow-up is as important as your treatment. PROGNOSIS Prognosis means prediction. It is an educated guess about the future course of a disease in a specific individual. Prognosis is based on the type of tumor, its grade, location and spread (if any); the age of the patient; how long the patient had symptoms before the tumor was diagnosed; how much the tumor has affected the patient’s ability to function; and the extent of surgery if surgery was performed. The availability of successful therapies also influences the prognosis. A benign tumor located in a vital area may be life threatening, while certain malignant tumors may be successfully treated with radiation or chemotherapy . WHAT HAPPENS NEXT Your mind is probably racing with thoughts and filled with lots of questions. One way to help stay organized and in control is to write your questions in a notebook. Try listing your questions by placing important questions near the top or number the questions in order of importance. This list will help ensure that your concerns are addressed by helping you stay organized and focused. It can also be helpful to have a friend or family member accompany you to your appointment. Not only can they offer comfort and moral support, they can help make sure that your questions are being asked and answered by checking off questions from the list and writing down responses. If it’s OK with your doctor, bring a recording device with you. Then, you can listen to the doctor again in the comfort of your own home. During your doctors’ visits, ask for written information about your brain tumor, your symptoms, suggested treatments and your medications. Some insurance companies require pre-certification of scans. Check your policy for guidelines. If you call for pre-certification, record the date, the name of the representative to whom you speak and their response. Before you leave the doctor’s office, make sure you understand any instructions that were given. For example, do you have another appointment? If so, when is it? If you are scheduled to have additional tests, do you know why , when and where to go? Ask the doctor or nurse to write important dates and instructions in your notebook. QUESTIONS TO ASK Whether you are just beginning treatment, are a long term survivor or are somewhere in between, you probably have some unasked or unanswered questions. You might be concerned about your symptoms or want to ask about treatment options. You may have obtained copies of your medical records and read something you don’t understand. Or perhaps you would like guidance about resuming your routine activities. We encourage you to take these questions to your health care team. Your doctors and nurses can CHAPTER  : DIAGNOSIS specialize in the treatment of brain tumors. An out- of-network doctor may result in additional costs and/or other responsibilities for the policy holder. It’s important to know what those obligations would be before selecting a doctor. Once you select the consulting doctor(s), call their office and ask about their procedure for obtaining a second opinion. Some doctors will review medical records and scans, without the patient being present. Others will ask to see the patient, too. The doctor’s office can provide a list of the medical records needed to render an opinion and the best way to have them delivered. Questions for a Specialist You’ll want to know: • What treatment is recommended? • What is the goal of that treatment? To cure the tumor, to control the tumor or to control symptoms? • What are the potential benefits of the treatment? • What are the risks and side effects of the treatment? • What will happen if I don’t have this treatment or if I postpone it? • Are there other options beside this treatment? • Is this an experimental treatment? • Will I need any more tests before the treatment begins? • How will we know if the treatment was effective? • What type of follow-up will I need and when? OBTAINING MEDICAl RECORDS Medical records are needed for a second opinion. However, the laws for obtaining records vary by state. Many states allow medical records to be released directly to the patient. Other states require that medical records be sent directly to the consulting physician. The quickest way to obtain these records is from the doctor’s office. Copies of scans, pathology , operative and consultation reports, as well as office visit records, are generally available from the doctor’s office. Your doctor may be able to access your scans electronically and copy them for you. There may be a charge for providing a copy of medical records. The consulting doctor will also ask to see the actual scans (not just the reports). If your doctor does not have the scans, call the hospital radiology or imaging department where the scan was done. MRI, CT, fMRI and PET scans can all be copied. Never send an original through the mail! Since there is a sizeable fee to copy scans, get a list of the exact scans needed. Some hospitals store reports and scans in electronic or digital, files. These files can be copied onto a CD or DVD, transferred electronically or printed as traditional records. The consulting doctor can tell you which version is preferred. Some consulting doctors (and some patients) ask for a second reading of the pathology slides. To obtain your slides, call the pathology department of the hospital where the surgery was performed. Some slides can be copied. If they cannot be copied, ask if the hospital has a “paraffin block” sample of your tumor tissue. This is a larger piece of tissue, stored in a wax base, from which new slides may be created. Paraffin blocks, due to their size, are usually kept only a few years. Slides may be kept longer. Again, there may be a charge to duplicate or ship the pathology slides. Written records of hospitalizations are kept in the medical records department of the hospital for several years. Afterward, they may be copied into electronic files or otherwise archived. CHAPTER  : DIAGNOSIS   www.abta.orgChapter  : Seizures Seizures are common symptoms of a brain tumor. Between   and  % of people diagnosed with a brain tumor will have a seizure at some time during their illness. A seizure can be a startling experience. However, understanding what a seizure is and what to do if one should occur, can minimize fear and potential injury . For some people, a seizure may be the first clue that something unusual is happening in their brain. Seizures might be caused by a brain tumor or by the surgery to remove it. Seizures can also be totally unrelated to a brain tumor. For example, an injury to the head, a stroke, alcohol or drug withdrawal, and fever can all cause seizures. Or, the cause may be unknown. Most seizures can be controlled with medications called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Surgery or a ketogenic diet are also sometimes used to help treat ongoing seizures. This chapter provides information and resources to help people affected by seizures understand what they are experiencing and to learn how to live with this symptom. CHAPTER  : SEIZURES the person’s mouth, including your fingers. During a seizure, anything placed in the mouth will block the airway and cause breathing problems. Also, as the jaw often clenches during a seizure, your fingers could be bitten. Most seizures last several minutes. After the seizure ends, allow time for the per son to recover. They may be confused for a few moments. This is normal. Help re-orient them. Tell them who you are, where they are and what happened. Help them find a place to rest until they have recovered. Call for emergency assistance if: • The person is having difficulty breathing • The person injures himself • The seizure lasts more than   minutes • A second seizure immediately follows • The seizure occurs in water TYPES Of SEIZURES There are two primary types of seizures – partial and generalized. The type you experience depends on which area of the brain has the abnormal electrical signals. Partial Seizures There are two types of partial seizures – simple and complex. Simple Partial Seizures Simple partial seizures commonly cause jerking or twitching (if the frontal lobe is involved), tingling or numbness (if the parietal lobe is involved) or other sensations. These symptoms can begin in one part of the body and then spread to other areas. Chewing movements or lip smacking (if the anterior temporal lobe is involved), buzzing in the ears, flashes of lights, sweating, flushing and pupil dilation are other common symptoms. Psychic symptoms include a sense of déjà vu, imaginary sights (if the occipital lobe is involved), smells (if the temporal lobe is involved), tastes or imaginary sounds. Simple partial seizures do not cause unconsciousness.Complex Partial Seizures Complex partial seizures cause some loss of consciousness and usually indicate temporal lobe involvement. Uncontrolled body movements might occur. The seizure may be preceded, accompanied by or followed by psychic symptoms. A state of confusion may continue after the seizure activity . In patients with low- grade gliomas, this is the most common type of seizure. Generalized Seizures These seizures may begin as partial seizures and abruptly change into generalized seizures. There are several different types of generalized seizures. Absence (Petit Mal) Seizures Absence seizures cause a brief delay in consciousness and may be accompanied by a feeling of limpness. The person having the seizure may miss a few words or stop speaking for a few seconds during a conversation. It may look like daydreaming. The beginning and end of the episode is usually sudden. This type of seizure most commonly begins in childhood and often stops by young adulthood. Atypical Absence Seizures Atypical absence seizures may cause more extensive changes in muscle tone or they may have a more gradual beginning and ending than typical absence seizures. Atonic Seizures (Drop Attacks) Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden limpness. Generally , all muscle tone and consciousness are lost. Myoclonic Seizures Myoclonic seizures cause single or multiple muscle twitches, jerks or spasms. Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizures Tonic-clonic seizures are common in people with low-grade gliomas, but can occur with any type of glioma. The seizure involves a sudden outburst, then a loss of consciousness, followed by twitching and relaxing muscle contractions. CHAPTER  : SEIZURES how often the seizures occur, your MRI scans, EEG (electroencephalogram) results and your treatments. The decision to taper off antiepileptic medication should be carefully planned by the doctor and patient, with all appropriate precautions taken. Medication should never be abruptly stopped without a doctor’s approval, as it may trigger a seizure. If one medication doesn’t control the seizures, another drug or a combination of drugs may be prescribed. TIPS fOR MANAGING COMMON AED SIDE EffECTS Discuss side effects with your doctor – especially if they persist and do not feel manageable. The following information may help you manage some common side effects of seizure medications. Drowsiness or Dizziness For your own protection, do not operate equipment or machinery and do not drink alcoholic beverages. Use caution on stairways. Install grab bars in the shower and next to the toilet. (These can be rented from a medical supply store.) Gum Swelling Your gums may be inflamed, red, swollen, tender or bleeding. Good oral hygiene, with regular brushing and flossing, is key in managing this side effect that is influenced by bacteria levels in the mouth. If your gums are swollen, try using a soft tooth brush or a mouth care sponge (available at most drug stores). Avoid mouthwashes containing alcohol that may burn and irritate your gums. Baking soda-based mouth rinses may provide relief. Be sure to tell your dentist about your medication. Frequent professional cleanings may help limit gum swelling. Rash Notify your doctor immediately . A rash can indicate an allergic reaction to the seizure medication or may be due to an increased drug level. If itching accompanies the rash, a cool shower may provide relief by constricting the blood vessels in the outer layer of your skin. Pat your skin dry instead of rubbing. Do not use lotions on the rash unless your doctor or nurse suggests it. Do not take additional doses of the medication that may be causing the rash until you have spoken with your doctor. Bone Disorder Long-term use of seizure medications may cause bone disorders. The amount of calcium in the bone may decrease causing brittle bones and fractures. Decreased levels of vitamin D and phosphorus may also contribute to this side effect. Bone and blood tests can monitor these conditions and supplementation may be recommended. Regular exercise also supports healthy bones. Nausea and Vomiting Take your medication with meals to decrease stomach upset. If stomach upset continues, ask your doctor about anti-nausea (antiemetic) medication. Do not use over-the-counter antacids or aspirin-containing preparations for upset stomachs without first checking with your doctor since they may interfere with some seizure medications. Continued Seizures Some seizures simply do not respond to a given medication and you may have to try another medication. Flu vaccines, prescription and non- prescription drugs can increase seizure activity . If you suspect that you are experiencing this problem, make a list of all your medications and share it with your doctor or pharmacist. Be sure to let your doctor know the frequency and type of your seizures and if the side effects of a particular drug interfere with your quality of life. Discuss this with your doctor and ask about other options for controlling your seizures. CHAPTER  : SEIZURES Driving Laws prohibiting people with seizures from driving are designed to protect both you and other people from injury . Talk with a licensed health care professional to explore alternative transportation methods, join a carpool and offer to pay extra for the gas, contact your city’s public transportation center, ask if your church or a faith-based community organization offers volunteer drivers or check to see if your community offers a shuttle bus/discounted taxi services for seniors or those with a disability .

THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  BRAIN TUMORS IN CHIlDREN Most pediatric brain and spine tumors are primary tumors, meaning they originated in the brain or spine. The most common types of brain tumors in children are astrocytoma, medulloblastoma and ependymoma (see Chapter   for specific tumor descriptions). This is a full listing of pediatric tumor types: • ATRT • Brain stem glioma • Choroid plexus tumors, choroid plexus carcinoma, choroid plexus papilloma • Craniopharyngioma • Cysts • Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma • Ependymoma • Germ cell tumors • Medulloblastoma • Neurofibromatosis • Oligodendroglioma • Optic glioma • PNET If your child has been diagnosed with a brain tumor, you probably have very specific questions. Your doctor can respond best to your concerns about the tumor, the treatment plan and what to expect in the future. THE CARE TEAM Pediatric brain tumors require specialized care that is most often provided by a team of specialists at a large medical center or pediatric hospital. The team may include pediatric neurosurgeons; pediatric oncologists; pediatric radiation oncologists; rehabilitation specialists in occupational therapy , physical therapy and speech therapy; pediatric nurse specialists; social workers; child life specialists and others. Additionally , since most of these programs are at teaching hospitals, medical residents and fellows will be involved in your child’s care. Parents or other significant caregivers are also critical members of the care team. You are your child’s best and most important advocate when it comes to medical care. You will have lots of questions. You will have to make many decisions. Talk with your medical team early and often. It can take some time for all of the pieces to fall into place. Be patient with yourself. There can be a good deal to learn. TREATMENT OPTIONS Treating brain and spine tumors in children is different than treating adults. Children’s brains and bodies are still developing, so there are different considerations and standards of care. For most children, treatment starts with surgery . A biopsy following surgery will help to classify and grade the tumor. Following surgery , additional treatment may be required. Possible therapies include: • Chemotherapy • Conventional radiation therapy • Stereotactic radiosurgery , a precise form of radiation therapy • Stem-cell rescue, blood and marrow transplantation • Interventions to address side effects of the tumor or the treatment • Rehabilitation to regain lost strength and skills • Ongoing follow-up care for long-term management and to detect recurrence of the tumor Clinical Trials Your doctors may suggest that your child be enrolled in a clinical trial. Clinical trials offer CHAPTER  : PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS , patients and others. To learn more about how this diagnosis can affect your family and learn ways to help cope with the challenges see Chapter   on Coping.TAlKING TO YOUR CHIlD OR TEEN You don’t have to have all the answers when your child is the patient, but you do need to have conversations. Most medical teams have a social worker or child life specialist who can help you explain the diagnosis, tests and treatments in a way your child or teen will understand. Accurate information presented in a non-threatening, age- appropriate way can prevent children from imagining explanations that are scarier than the truth and can help them better cope with tests and treatments. Avoiding the topic does not eliminate the concerns or questions your child has, even if they do not express them. Open, honest and loving conversations help to address fears and misconceptions. Create an atmosphere where your child will want to ask questions or return to the topic whenever new questions or concerns arise. Some children will want lots of details; others will not. Follow your child’s lead. Discussing the diagnosis, tests and treatments is also an important opportunity to reassure your child or teen. Children and teens have misconceptions that must be addressed, including: • This illness is not the result of something you did or did not do. It is not related to your behavior or your thoughts. It is not a punishment. • A tumor is not contagious. You cannot “get it” or “give it” to anyone. • You are still you. Having a tumor in your brain does not change who you are. It also does not change my love for you. • Be prepared for difficult questions including “Am I going to die?” Be honest and direct. Tell your child that everyone is different and reacts differently to the illness and the treatment. Together with your medical team you are doing everything you can to make the illness go away . For more topics or sample explanations for talking to children with a brain tumor, see Chapter   “Coping” on pg  . SIBlINGS When a child has a tumor, the impact of the situation quickly extends to the entire family . Routines are disrupted. Priorities are shuffled. Parents are pulled away from other day-to-day activities to attend to the needs of the child. Necessity requires brothers and sisters to be left in the care of other family or friends. Everyone is worried. Siblings can feel confused, neglected and guilty . In the rush of medical needs, it can be easy to short change conversations with brothers and sisters. Even at an early age, children sense when there is something wrong. They may even think that they created the problem. Keeping brothers and sisters informed helps them feel connected to their sibling. Provide honest, age-sensitive information. Address Their fears and Concerns Common misconceptions arise among siblings, too. “Can I catch it? Did I cause it? Will I get it?” The social worker or child life specialist on your medical team can help you communicate effectively with family members, too. Engage Them The treatment process can be lengthy . Siblings can feel as if all the attention and energy is spent on just one child in the family . Once the immediate crisis passes, find ways to reconnect. Share a meal, a goodnight book, a conversation while driving. Focus on quality , not quantity . Even if you have just a little time to spare, devoting your undivided attention to others in the family will make a difference. Involve Them Oftentimes, brothers and sisters want to help. They want to visit the hospital, send cards, organize a bake sale. If that is the case, try to find ways for them to help. It will give them a concrete way to process their own emotions and to demonstrate some small measure of control over what is happening in their lives. IMPACT ON RElATIONSHIPS A crisis can bring out the best in relationships, but that is not always the case. A crisis and its aftermath can strain healthy relationships and expose cracks in struggling relationships. Whether you are married or divorced, maintaining a relationship with a co-parent can be difficult while caring for a child with a brain tumor. Issues you have struggled with in the past can return. Guilt, anxiety , exhaustion and stress can complicate relationships even further. Try to maintain communication and honor the experience of others going through the situation. Be open and honest with your care team regarding relevant family history , custody and other emotional concerns that may spill over into the care environment. Be aware of the problems that can emerge in other family relationships including those with extended family members, in-laws, step families and the like. Each person has a legitimate interest in the child and the child’s treatment. Yet, it can be very frustrating and time consuming to communicate with each of them. Consider designating a close friend or other family member to serve as a “spokesperson” keeping all informed and updated. ABTA Careline ABTA ’s Careline can be a family’s single best resource.

These complications, known as “late effects” of treatment are not unique to children. However, because children can live for many decades post-treatment, it is essential that parents and other caregivers be aware of them. Surgery , radiation therapy and chemotherapy can all contribute to late effect complications. Late effects vary considerably based upon multiple factors including a person’s age, tumor type and location, treatment type and duration. Some effects may be apparent almost immediately , but some may not emerge until years after treatment has stopped. It is extremely important that brain tumor survivors of all ages be followed by a medical team versed in late effects throughout their lifespan. Some of the more common complications of treatment are listed below. Some can be addressed through rehabilitation and other accommodations. All require ongoing monitoring. • Physical disabilities such as weakness of muscles and diminished coordination • Learning disabilities including problems with memory , attention, comprehension and information processing • Behavioral changes and emotional issues • Hearing and vision problems• Seizures and other neurological issues • Hormonal problems including slowed growth, hypo- or hyperthyroidism, diabetes, early or late puberty , and infertility • Damage to internal organs or other body systems • The possibility of developing secondary cancers in other parts of the body or a recurrence of a tumor in the brain lifetime Monitoring & Maintaining Medical Records Childhood brain tumor survivors need to be closely monitored. Most large pediatric brain tumor treatment programs have specific survivor programs. These programs provide specialized health monitoring throughout childhood. They also identify specific risks based upon a thorough review of the child’s medical history including identification of risks associated with specific tumor types or interventions. As a child enters adulthood, survivor programs help families transfer ongoing care out of the pediatric setting and into a medical program that can provide the specialized monitoring the patient will need as an adult. Parents and caregivers should maintain or know how to access a complete, detailed medical record of their son or daughter’s treatments. As more information is known regarding the effects of specific treatments, your child’s medical record will provide the information needed to better understand your child’s specific risks and influence the recommended course of follow-up. Your medical team is the first line of defense to address late effects and to ensure close monitoring of your child’s condition.

RETURNING TO SCHOOl “I think it’s time to go back to school.” After weeks or even months of treatment and recovery , these words are cause for celebration among children and parents. For many , returning to school is an important milestone on the road to normalcy . As wonderful as it is, the transition to school does require special attention and care. Your school-age son or daughter may have significantly different needs today and you may have lots of concerns and questions. Additionally , for some, a return to school is not a singular event as much as it is a fluid shifting of time spent at home, at school and in care. Start Early Returning to school is an exciting time, but it can be overwhelming for parents and children. Returning students have weathered difficult treatments that may have altered learning capabilities, behavior, strength, energy levels, coordination, speech, hearing or eyesight. It may be the first time your school has worked with a family in your specific situation. Communicating with the school early and often during treatment will help smooth the way for a good transition. While you child is still recovering in the hospital, contact their school regarding your child’s diagnosis and treatment. Keep teachers updated. It is critical to talk to your child about what he or she may (or may not) be comfortable revealing about this personal situation. Once informed, teachers and classmates can be a tremendous source of much-needed support during hospitalizations and home stays through cards, letters, phone calls, texts, social media and personal visits. Try to maintain education goals during treatment. Work with the school to complete assignments at home during recovery . Read to your child and keep them engaged with learning as much as possible during the time away from school.Tap Into Special Education Services As a return to school nears, meet with the principal and primary teacher and/or special education coordinator to discuss necessary accommodations. Bring brain tumor information from the ABTA with you to share. This is your opportunity to discuss your child’s diagnosis, treatment and the resulting physical, neuropsychological, emotional, social and/or behavioral changes. If your child has physical or learning disabilities following a brain tumor diagnosis and/or related treatment, your child may qualify for benefits or accommodations under one of two federal mandates; The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) or The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 – Section  . To access services under these mandates, request a school evaluation for your child. This will include a series of educational tests to determine how your child learns best and what type of accommodations will help your child to optimally learn. These services are usually coordinated by your school district’s special education department. Neuropsychological Testing There is ongoing research which shows that children treated for brain tumors may experience neuropsychological effects following treatment. Neuropsychological testing is done to help define the impact and identify learning disabilities. It can be used to assess processing speed, attention, visual motor integration, planning and organizing skills, visual and verbal memory , reading comprehension, math calculation, and applied abilities. Ideally , baseline testing is done before treatment starts and is done again prior to returning to school. Neuropsychological testing will help assess needs and identify the necessary accommodations for a student to succeed in a classroom environment. CHAPTER  : PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS   www.abta.orgWhether you are an individual with a brain tumor, a caregiver, family member or friend, you may still be trying to make sense out of the words “brain tumor.” You may be experiencing feelings of fear, uncertainty and isolation. It is important to know that these feelings are normal and that you are not alone. This chapter offers some helpful suggestions from professionals who specialize in helping people cope as well as some practical advice from other brain tumor survivors and their loved ones.Chapter  : Coping CHAPTER  : COPING depression and if so, will provide direction. The doctor may prescribe medication or suggest a psychiatric consultation. Depression is treatable, but must first be diagnosed. INClUDING f AMIl Y AND fRIENDS Life is about to change. For many , it helps to share your situation with family and friends who can offer support and help you work through your options. But telling your family and friends that you have a brain tumor can be difficult. If you are uncomfortable with doing this on your own, consider having a care conference or meeting with your doctor, health care team and the primary members of your family . Written publications and educational materials • “A brain tumor is a lump in the brain that doesn’t belong there. The doctor is going to operate and take it out. The operation will help get rid of the headaches.” • “A brain tumor is a collection of abnormal ‘cells’ in the brain which are growing out of control. These cells were originally normal brain cells, but something inside of them changed. For no good reason, they started to divide and make more of themselves. This growing collection of abnormal cells is called a tumor.” • “With a tumor in there, the computer center of my brain can’t work the way it is supposed to. That’s why I have headaches and seizures.” • “No one knows for sure what causes a brain tumor. They just happen. But we do know that nothing you did or thought or said caused the tumor. Nothing you ever wished made this happen. Nothing your brother or sister or friends said made this happen. We also know that you don’t ‘catch’ brain tumors from other people.” • “Would you like to talk about this? Is there anything that you would like to ask?” Above all, reassure your children they are loved and will be taken care of. It also is important for parents to try to ensure that routines within the family change as little as possible. Children find the “daily rules of family life” very important. They feel safe and thrive under day-to-day conditions that are easy to predict, are consistent and make them feel safe. Therefore, it is important that parents agree not only on what to tell their children, but how to keep their lives as normal as possible. If schedule changes become necessary , try to make the new schedule repeatable so it becomes a “routine.” The sameness will be a comfort to your children.Older children may link the diagnosis to stories of illness they’ve heard from friends or personal experience with grandparents or neighbors. Give older children the opportunity to ask questions or share their concerns. “Is there anything you’d like to ask?” can be difficult to say , but can open the door to clarifying misinformation as well as providing reassurance. Some children, especially pre-teens and teenagers, may begin to act out. They may get in trouble, begin to have problems in school or begin to do things they normally would not do. This is usually a sign that the child is having trouble coming to grips with what is happening within the family . It may be time for more direct action. A serious discussion with the child is very important at this stage. Involve them in the day-to-day family activities. If the behavior persists, it is time to seek professional help, such as counseling or family therapy . Many families find that after the initial diagnosis children learn to adjust and adapt to the news, especially if the parents are consistent and in agreement regarding family matters. Most importantly , remember that children of all ages need to be reassured of love. They need to know that they will be cared for during the parent’s illness. Neighbors and relatives can help keep the children’s routines as normal as possible. Plan ahead for special events. If an ill parent is unable to make the school play or watch softball practice, perhaps an aunt, uncle or friend can fill in. Although it won’t be the same without their parent, the child will know that mom or dad cared enough to ensure that someone would be there. The ABTA can help with sample conversations; support groups for parents, children and siblings; and other information. Contact the ABTA CareLine at  - -ABTA (2282) or abtacares@abta.org . REDUCING STRESS For most people, fears of the unknown and an uncertain future can cause great stress. This is normal. Give yourself permission to be temporarily overwhelmed. Then, take a few deep CHAPTER  : COPING • Allow yourself to cry . It’s a good escape valve for both women and men. • Set short term goals so you can feel good about your progress. • Find one thing good about each day . • Laughter helps. • Find purposeful things to do – a daily morning walk with a friend or invite your grandchild to lunch weekly . • Keep a journal. It’s a special place all for yourself. • Decorate a small box with bits of costume jewelry , brightly colored paint, wonderful pictures from old magazines. Put your worries in it and tightly close the lid. • Be kind to yourself. Take time to pamper yourself, make time to play , be lazy when you need to. • Set your own limits, not those expected by others. • Know that symptoms usually worsen in the darkened evening hours. This is generally when everyone is tired and defenseless and at their worst. Arranging for outside support or visitors in the evening may help. • Find someone to confide in. For both patients and families, support groups can be invaluable. They can help you know you are not the only one dealing with this situation. • Take breaks from the brain tumor world. Go to a movie, have a picnic in the park, invite friends to join you at a concert. Make time to do this regularly , even if “regularly” is only once a month. • Find a spiritual leader or contact your clergy .• If you are having a difficult time coping, seek professional help. • Read – about brain tumors, new treatments and about brain tumor survivors. Be positive and do not feel defeated. REACHING OUT fOR SUPPORT Most of us don’t want to be alone when facing a crisis. Emotional support from family , friends and loved ones can give us comfort and strength. However, this support may not be enough and there is often a need to connect with others in similar situations. There are many ways to reach for support but not all types of support are appropriate for everyone. We offer some information and resources to help patients and families decide which support resources might be best for them. Support Groups Patients and families often find help through brain tumor support groups. A support group is a face-to-face gathering of people seeking to share their experiences with one another with the help of a support group facilitator. They come for emotional, social and possibly , spiritual support. There are different types of support groups for adults, parents of children with brain tumors, children and siblings. While not for everyone, support groups may provide a comfortable, safe forum to share experiences and concerns, as well as practical information and strategies for dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of a brain tumor. Support groups are located throughout the country and most are open to both patients and family members. In large groups, patients and family members may meet separately . Support groups often vary in their formats. Some are strictly supportive, while others are strictly educational; many groups are both supportive and educational. Groups also are either “open” or “closed” to new members. Most groups are “open” and ongoing, meaning that members may join or leave the group as their needs change. There can be much stability CHAPTER  : COPING ABTA Connections Online Support Community The American Brain T umor Association Connections online support community connects patients, families, friends and caregivers for support and inspiration. Unlike social media outlets such as Facebook or T witter, Connections is a more private setting where members can ask questions of their peers, provide updates on their personal situations and gain confidence in and comfort through communicating with others who may be traversing a similar brain tumor journey . Members also maintain full control of their privacy settings without the distraction of ads and instant messages. Learn more at www.abta. inspire.com Individual/family Counseling Professional counseling can help with more complex issues or when informal support does not adequately meet someone’s needs. Clinical social workers, clinical psychologists, marriage and family therapists and clinical professional counselors can offer one-on-one and/or family counseling when more formal assistance is needed. For help in locating a professional counselor or therapist, please contact the ABTA CareLine at  - -ABTA (2282) or send an e-mail to abtacares@abta.org . Neuropsychologist A neuropsychologist is a mental health professional with expertise in assessing and treating problems of psychological functions and behavior, as they relate to the brain and central nervous system. A neuropsychological evaluation involves a variety of tests to assess one’s ability to remember, pay attention, use language, problem-solve and conceptualize. It also can assess perceptual and motor abilities, emotional state, behavior and personality . A complete assessment can take six to eight hours. Neuropsychological treatments include teaching ways to help individuals improve their impaired functions by learning strategies to compensate for lost or weakened abilities, despite limitations. When seeking a neuropsychologist, one factor to consider is whether or not the psychologist is board certified. Board certification refers to the certificate received once post-training examinations have been successfully passed. This is a mark of high distinction in the profession. A neurologist or neurosurgeon can recommend a board certified neuropsychologist or you can contact the ABTA for more information at  -  -ABTA (2282) or send an email to abtacares@ abta.org . WHERE DO WE GO fROM HERE? Eventually , the treatments are completed and the medical appointments get further apart. The pace slows and another period of adjustment begins. It is a time when it can be difficult to do nothing after having done so much. Your task now is becoming well again. Make appointments for your follow-up doctor visits or scans and mark them on your calendar. Begin to rebuild your life within the guidelines set by your health care team. Learn about healthful eating. Exercise within the guidelines given to you by your doctor. Get out, see friends and be good to yourself. But be patient – getting well takes time. The brain tumor world will always be some part of your life, even if it’s somewhere in the past. Learn where it belongs and what feels comfortable for your family . Your priorities will also change with time. That’s okay . The changes reflect your ability to adapt. Talk with your family and build this new future together. You and your family may continue to have questions about living with a brain tumor, wish to keep abreast of the newest findings in brain tumor treatment or learn more about the research that will someday lead to a cure. The ABTA website, www. abta.org, offers extensive brain tumor information, treatment and research updates, lists of family and professional brain tumor meetings and conferences, and information about upcoming ABTA events. THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  . Taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of your loved one. That can mean being kind to yourself, asking others to help, taking time away from the patient or allowing yourself a quiet moment to think and reflect. The following suggestions can help you get the assistance you need, while ensuring that you continue to care for yourself. As with any list of suggestions, pick those that work best for you.  www.abta.org AllOW YOURSElf TO ASK QUESTIONS The words brain tumor can be overwhelming. It’s common for families to make a visit to the doctor, hear terms and phrases they’ve never heard before and then be asked to make a decision. Back at home, there may be a flood of doubts as to what was heard and whether it was understood. If you have questions about the information your family was given, call the doctor. If you did not understand something that was told to you or you have additional questions you forgot to ask, call the doctor. The doctor believes you understand everything that was said unless you speak up. And, having answers to your questions can be a great stress reducer. ASSESS WHAT YOU NEED Have a clear sense of what it is that would be most helpful to you as a caregiver. To do this, ask yourself: “What help or information, if it were available, would make caregiving significantly easier right now?” Be very specific. Do you need help with the grocery shopping or someone to come in a few times a week so you can get out of the house? If you need to talk to someone, are you looking for a sympathetic ear or someone to help you solve a problem? Be selective about the information and resources you choose. Always come back to the question: “What is it I need?” as opposed to “What is available?” DElEGATE RESPONSIBIlITY Don’t do everything yourself if there are others in your family who can help. Sit down and discuss what each member of the household – including children – can do and develop a schedule of responsibilities. Take into account each person’s ability , maturity and availability . Remember that not everyone can or should, be directly involved in caring for the patient; there will be other tasks which also need attention. Look beyond the immediate relatives for help – even those further away can participate on some level. Finding others to handle family tasks will give you more time to care for your loved one and yourself and, thus, help reduce stress.ACCEPT ASSISTANCE If there are no other members of your household or relatives close by , look to friends or members of your church or social group for help. Often, people want to help but are not sure what they can do. Be prepared to respond to their offers. Try to determine the time, money or energy commitment they are willing to make and give them one or two suggestions that fit their level of commitment. Some people may be available on a one-time basis to run an errand, baby-sit or help with a particular household chore. Others may be available more regularly or for longer periods of time. Ask for help with grocery shopping, cooking and freezing meals, yard work, household repairs, driving car pool or driving to therapy appointments. Those living further away may be able to help with financial needs, filing insurance claims or searching for support resources. If people offer help at a time when you really do not need it, tell them how much you appreciate their offer and their friendship. Suggest they ask again in a few weeks or ask if you may call on them if your needs change. You also can suggest they help in some less tangible way such as making a visit, saying a prayer or lending a supportive ear when you need it. ACCESS HOME HEAl TH CARE Home health care agencies and caregivers are available to offer additional support and respite care. Skilled services may include medical care and/or physical, occupational and speech therapy . Home health aides may help with personal services like bathing, dressing, eating and household chores. Adult day care also is available in many communities. UTIlIZE ONlINE SUPPORT GROUPS AND WEBSITES There are a variety of Internet-based resources, including online support groups, listservs, chat rooms, message boards and other Internet communities of interest, through which caregivers can share information and support each other. There are also websites focused on CHAPTER  : fOR THE CAREGIVER . These Internet-based forums offer an alternative for those who do not have access to a face-to-face support group in their area or who prefer to communicate and seek information by the Internet. Most online forums require that you subscribe or register prior to sending messages. After subscribing as directed, you’ll receive a confirmation as well as a welcome message. Each forum has its own etiquette rules and procedures. Save those guidelines; they will also tell you how to unsubscribe should you so choose. The group may also provide you with directions for obtaining your email in digest form, a simple way of gathering all the participant messages into one email or one folder. ABTA Connections Online Support Community The American Brain T umor Association Connections online support community connects patients, families, friends and caregivers for support and inspiration.

BE KIND TO YOURSElf When you are feeling particularly self-critical, stop and ask yourself “What would I say to a friend who was feeling guilty about something he or she did or neglected to do?” or “Would I think less of my friend or would I understand that he or she is doing the best anyone could under the circumstances?” When we apply this test, I think most of us have no problem letting our hypothetical friend “off the hook.” When you fall short of your expectations, be at least as kind to yourself as you would be to a good friend. BE ASSERTIVE Learn to say no. Set limits on your time. Be realistic about what you can and cannot be responsible for right now. Consider asking friends to visit during hours that are convenient for you and your loved one. If you find yourself with visitors who sometimes “wear out their welcome,” ask if you might use the time during their next visit to run errands.TAKE CARE Of YOUR BODY It is not uncommon for caregivers to neglect their own health while trying to provide the best care possible for the person they are caring for. And yet neglecting your health can leave you vulnerable to exhaustion and disease. To prevent illness, do a regular self-check to see how you are feeling. Ask yourself: “How am I feeling today? When was the last time I saw my doctor for a check-up or for treatment of an ongoing problem? Is it time to make an appointment?” Make sure you are eating regular, nutritious meals; exercising (check with a doctor before starting any new exercise routines) and sleeping regularly . DISCUSS YOUR fEElINGS Having someone to talk with also can be very helpful. A relative, a friend or a member of your clergy all can be important parts of your social network. Sometimes it helps to let that person know that you don’t expect answers or solutions, just a sympathetic ear. If you are seeking advice, look for someone who will continue to be supportive even if you decide not to take their advice. And make sure you feel better after talking with the person you select. Support that doesn’t feel like support usually isn’t. Support groups with other caregivers can be another valuable resource. Many of these groups welcome family members and caregivers. We can provide you with a list of support groups in your state. Call the ABTA CareLine at  - -ABTA (2282) or email abtacares@abta.org . If you find that friends and family and other non- professional support resources just aren’t enough or you continue to feel consistently overwhelmed, you may wish to consult with a mental health professional. Your doctor can refer you to one. Professional mental health associations also can help you locate someone in your area. MAKE TIME fOR YOURSElf Try to take a break from caregiving for at least a few hours or longer each week, if you can. It can  be difficult to leave your loved one, especially if they are very ill, but it may be the most important thing you do for that person and for yourself. Taking this time is not being selfish. Rather, it is critical in order for you to continue caring for your loved one’s physical and emotional needs in a loving and helpful way . Use your time to do something that you enjoy or find relaxing. Meditation, guided imagery and exercise or movement classes may reduce stress. Even simple everyday activities, such as going for a walk, listening to soothing music or reading a good book can give you a break from responsibility and worry . KEEP IT SIMPlE Most importantly , try to keep life as simple as possible during this challenging time: • Be flexible. This is not to discount the value of routines. However, we all encounter situations where we are just “out there winging it.” Don’t be afraid to try doing things in different ways. Re-evaluate your needs and priorities. What was important before your family member became ill, like having an immaculate house, may not be important now. And some things that weren’t important before, like getting enough sleep or finding time for you, may be crucial now. Adopt a problem-solving approach. Break down what you need to accomplish into smaller steps and then brainstorm ways to get from one step to the next. • Decide to do one thing today . This simple strategy can be very helpful when you feel you are not accomplishing anything, despite always feeling busy . Simply decide to do one thing you’ve been putting off and just do it. It can be something as simple as cleaning out a file, doing the laundry or making a phone call to the insurance company . Once you have done that “one thing,” it’s amazing how much better you feel being able to cross it off your mental “to-do” list. • Laugh. The importance of laughter cannot be overemphasized. Laughter can ease tension, promote relaxation and help you reconnect with the joy of living. THE ABTA IS HERE fOR YOU You don’t have to go through this journey alone.

THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  fACTS AND STATISTICS Brain tumors do not discriminate. Primary brain tumors – those that begin in the brain and tend to stay in the brain – occur in people of all ages, but they are statistically more frequent in children and older adults. Metastatic brain tumors – those that begin as a cancer elsewhere in the body and spread to the brain – are more common in adults than children. Brain tumors are the: • Leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children (males and females) under age   (leukemia is the first) • Second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in males ages  –  (leukemia is the first) • Fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in females ages  –  Incidence Statistics An estimated  ,  new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2015 and includes both malignant ( , ) and non- malignant ( , ) brain tumors. These estimates are based on an application of age-sex-race- specific incidence rates from the 2014 CBTRUS Statistical Report using 2007-2011 SEER and NPCR data to project 2015 US population estimates for the respective age-sex-race groups (estimation methodology can be found at www.idph.state.il.us/cancer/statistics.htm#PR ). In 2015, approximately  ,  children between the ages of  -  will be diagnosed with primary brain tumors. In 2015, an estimated  ,  new cases of childhood primary brain and central nervous system tumors are expected to be diagnosed in children ages   –  . Prevalence Statistics It is estimated that during the year 2010 more than  ,  people in the United States were living with the diagnosis of a primary brain or central nervous system tumor. Specifically , more than  ,  persons were living with a malignant tumor and more than  ,  persons were living with a non-malignant tumor. CHAPTER  : BRAIN TUMOR fACTS AND STATISTICS   www.abta.orgChapter  : Brain Tumor Terminology Basal Ganglia The basal ganglia are masses of nerve cells deep within the cerebral hemispheres (the two halves of the cerebrum, the largest area of the brain). Brain Stem The brain stem is the bottom-most portion of the brain. It connects the cerebrum (largest area of the brain) with the spinal cord. The midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata and reticular formation are all part of the brain stem. Cerebellopontine Angle The cerebellopontine angle is the angle between the pons (part of the brain stem) and the cerebellum (second largest area of the brain). Cerebellum The cerebellum is the second largest area of the brain. It is located in the portion of the brain in the back of the head between the cerebrum and the brain stem. It consists of two lateral lobes and a central lobe. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSf) Cerebrospinal fluid is the clear, watery fluid made in the ventricles that bathes and cushions the brain and spinal cord. It circulates through the ventricles and around the surface of the brain. Cerebrum/Cerebral Hemispheres The largest area of the brain is the cerebrum, which consists of the right and left cerebral hemispheres. In general, the right cerebral hemisphere controls the left side of the body and the left cerebral hemisphere controls the right side of the body . Each hemisphere is comprised of four sections called lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Each lobe controls a specific group of activities. CHAPTER  : BRAIN TUMOR TERMINOlOGY Meningioma is a tumor that arises from the meninges. Midbrain The midbrain is the short portion of the brain stem between the pons (part of the brain stem) and the cerebral hemispheres. The 3rd and 4th cranial nerves originate in the midbrain. Optic Chiasm The optic chiasm is the area under the hypothalamus where each of the two optic nerves crosses over to the opposite side, forming an X shape. Pineal Gland The pineal gland lies below the corpus callosum (the nerve fibers that connect the two halves of the cerebral hemispheres). It produces the hormone melatonin, which is believed to control the biological rhythm of the body . Pituitary Gland The pituitary gland is attached to and receives messages from, the hypothalamus. It is composed of two lobes, the anterior and the posterior. The pituitary produces several hormones including prolactin, corticotropin and growth hormone. Pons Pons is a part of the brain stem that contains the origins of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th cranial nerves. Posterior fossa (Infratentorium) The tentorium separates the posterior fossa from the cerebral hemispheres. The area below the tentorium is called the infratentorium or the posterior fossa. This area within the skull contains the cerebellum and the brain stem. The area above the tentorium is called the supratentorium.
