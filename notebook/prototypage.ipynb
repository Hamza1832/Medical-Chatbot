THE BRAIN TUMOR GUIDE For Newly Diagnosed Patients and Their Families  INTRODUCTION Causes and risk factors can be environmental , such as being exposed to poisonous substances in the home or at work; eating or not eating certain foods; or whether or not we exercise, smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. They can also be genetic , such as being born with a gene mutation or susceptibility that one inherits from parents. These genetic mutations/susceptibilities may also accumulate over time, as one grows older. Unfortunately , no risk factor accounting for the majority of brain tumors has been identified, even though many environmental and genetic factors have been and are currently being studied. ENVIRONMENTAl f ACTORS Many studies have looked at a wide spectrum of environmental factors as possible causes of brain tumors including but not limited to: • Being exposed to air pollution, residential power lines, second hand smoke, agricultural chemicals and industrial formaldehyde • Working in synthetic rubber manufacturing or petroleum refining/production • Smoking cigarettes, smoking cigarettes while pregnant and consuming alcohol • Using common medications like birth control pills, sleeping pills, headache remedies, over-the-counter pain treatments and antihistamines • Having a history of head trauma, epilepsy , seizures or convulsions • Experiencing viruses and common infections • Consuming cured foods (nitrites) These exposures are difficult to accurately measure and can lead to inconsistencies across studies, making the results difficult to validate. Additional long-term research on these factors is needed before definite conclusions can be formed. Of the long list of factors studied, only exposure to ionizing radiation has been consistently associated with an increased risk for developing a brain tumor. (Ionizing radiation uses “high-frequency” energy waves such as X-rays or gamma rays. However, radiation doses used today for medical and dental therapies are better focused than those used in medicine decades ago.) On the other hand, some studies have shown that a history of allergies as an adult, eating fruits and vegetables as a child and having a mother who ate fruits and vegetables during pregnancy and having chicken pox as a child puts one at a decreased risk of development of brain tumors. Of particular interest over the last decade has been the potential association between cell phone use and risk of developing a brain tumor. Multiple large studies have been performed in both the United States and Europe. Some have shown an association between cell phone use and brain tumor risk, while other studies show no association. In addition, studies have also investigated the difference in risk of a brain tumor between short-term and long-term (>  years) cell phone use with further conflicting results. In general, the conclusions from most of these studies are ( ) there is no consistent association between cell phone use and risk of developing a brain tumor (benign or malignant) and ( ) there is a very slight increased risk of a brain tumor associated with using a cell phone for   years or more. Further studies, in both the laboratory and in humans with longer follow up, are needed to fully understand this exposure and any potential relationship with brain tumor development. Additional research is needed before definite conclusions can be formed. ABOUT ClUSTERS Of BRAIN TUMORS Understandably , communities become concerned when several individuals within a neighborhood are diagnosed with brain tumors. Scientists studying these groups will want to learn whether these are metastatic brain tumors (those that CHAPTER  : CAUSES AND RISK fACTORS • Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors play a role in making sure that the cell goes through its growth cycle normally . • DNA repair genes make proteins that control accurate repair of damaged DNA. • Carcinogen metabolizing genes make proteins that break down toxic chemicals i', 0.8532605767250061)\n",

With the publication of the Human Genome and advances in genotyping technology , scientists can now identify over a million genetic variants found in the human body and ask the question: “Are any of these inherited genetic variants associated with risk of a brain tumor?” This type of study is called a genome-wide association (GWA) study . T wo recent GWA studies of glioma found some results in common, but they also found some differing results. The scientists involved in these studies believe the differences in their results may be due to the differences in the people who were part of their studies. This research shows that common genetic differences amongst the population can contribute to risk for developing a malignant brain tumor. Much more investigation is needed to fully understand the importance of these variations and how they may impact brain tumor risk. This type of GWA study has yet to be performed for benign brain tumors or pediatric brain tumors. “Acquired” or “somatic” means genetic changes that have accumulated over time. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project Studies of any specific gene are complicated by the fact that there are many potential genes in the human genome to consider. While these genes interact with one another, they may also interact with environmental factors as well. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project, funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), has a goal of completely cataloging all of the somatic genetic changes in more than   different cancers, then making these data publically available in order to improve the ability to diagnose, treat and prevent cancer. TCGA started as a pilot project in 2006 prioritizing glioblastoma (GBM), ovarian and lung cancers as the first cancers to study . The first GBM paper published under this project showed three biological pathways involved with GBM. Since that publication, other scientists have described additional key genetic changes associated with malignant brain tumors. Some of these reports include important comparisons with low grade gliomas and other glioma subtypes. TCGA is now expanding its efforts to include other types and grades of gliomas. Chromosome Changes Another area of scientific study is the ability tumors have to lose or gain pieces of chromosomes . Each normal cell in any human body has   pairs of chromosomes. The most common chromosomal changes in brain tumors occur on chromosomes  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . Changes on chromosomes   and   are most frequently found in oligodendrogliomas. Changes on chromosome   are most frequently found in meningiomas. Scientists are studying how this information can best be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes. CHAPTER  : CAUSES AND RISK fACTORS   www.abta.orgChapter  : Symptoms and Side Effects The symptoms of a brain tumor are different in each person. While it is not possible to know exactly what symptoms to expect, understanding what might occur', 0.8683999259233517)\n",
      "(19, 'nding what a seizure is and what to do if one should occur, can minimize fear and potential injury . For some people, a seizure may be the first clue that something unusual is happening in their brain. Seizures might be caused by a brain tumor or by the surgery to remove it. Seizures can also be totally unrelated to a brain tumor. For example, an injury to the head, a stroke, alcohol or drug withdrawal, and fever can all cause seizures. Or, the cause may be unknown. Most seizures can be controlled with medications called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Surgery or a ketogenic diet are also sometimes used to help treat ongoing seizures. This chapter provides information and resources to help people affected by seizures understand what they are experiencing and to learn how to live with this symptom. CHAPTER  : SEIZURES the person’s mouth, including your fingers. During a seizure, anything placed in the mouth will block the airway and cause breathing problems. Also, as the jaw often clenches during a seizure, your fingers could be bitten. Most seizures last several minutes. After the seizure ends, allow time for the per son to recover. They may be confused for a few moments. This is normal. Help re-orient them. Tell them who you are, where they are and what happened. Help them find a place to rest until they have recovered. Call for emergency assistance if: • The person is having difficulty breathing • The person injures himself • The seizure lasts more than   minutes • A second seizure immediately follows • The seizure occurs in water TYPES Of SEIZURES There are two primary types of seizures – partial and generalized. The type you experience depends on which area of the brain has the abnormal electrical signals. Partial Seizures There are two types of partial seizures – simple and complex. Simple Partial Seizures Simple partial seizures commonly cause jerking or twitching (if the frontal lobe is involved), tingling or numbness (if the parietal lobe is involved) or other sensations. These symptoms can begin in one part of the body and then spread to other areas. Chewing movements or lip smacking (if the anterior temporal lobe is involved), buzzing in the ears, flashes of lights, sweating, flushing and pupil dilation are other common symptoms. Psychic symptoms include a sense of déjà vu, imaginary sights (if the occipital lobe is involved), smells (if the temporal lobe is involved), tastes or imaginary sounds. Simple partial seizures do not cause unconsciousness.Complex Partial Seizures Complex partial seizures cause some loss of consciousness and usually indicate temporal lobe involvement. Uncontrolled body movements might occur. The seizure may be preceded, accompanied by or followed by psychic symptoms. A state of confusion may continue after the seizure activity . In patients with low- grade gliomas, this is the most common type of seizure. Generalized Seizures These seizures may begin as partial seizures and abruptly change into generalized seizures. There are several different types of generalized seizures. Absence (Petit Mal) Seizures Absence seizures cause a brief delay in consciousness and may be accompanied by a feeling of limpness. The person having the seizure may miss a few words or stop speaking for a few seconds during a conversation. It may look like daydreaming. The beginning and end of the episode is usually sudden. This type of seizure most commonly begins in childhood and often stops by young adulthood. Atypical Absence Seizures Atypical absence seizures may cause more extensive changes in muscle tone or they may have a more gradual beginning and ending than typical absence seizures. Atonic Seizures (Drop Attacks) Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden limpness. Generally , all muscle tone and consciousness are lost. Myoclonic Seizures Myoclonic seizures cause single or multiple muscle twitches, jerks or spasms. Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizures Tonic-clonic seizures are common in people with low-grade gliomas', 0.8714233564482117)\n"
