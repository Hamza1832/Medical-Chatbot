Neutrophils also amplify their own recruitment by releasing leukotriene LTB 4 upon urate crystal phagocytosis (see Figure 24–2 ). FIGURE 24–2 The mechanisms of the initiation and amplification of the acute inflammatory response in gout involve both cytokines and humoral mediators. The intense inflammatory response in gout typically resolves spontaneously and completely over the course of several days, even without therapy. This down-modulation of the inflammatory response is a typical feature of acute inflammation, whereby the inflammatory response itself successfully removes the pro-inflammatory stimulus ( Table 24–1 ). Numerous mechanisms appear to be responsible: (1) efficient crystal phagocytosis, preventing the activation of newly recruited inflammatory cells; (2) increased heat and fluid influx, altering the local physical and chemical conditions to favor crystal solubilization; (3) coating of crystals with serum proteins, rendering the surface of the crystals less inflammatory; (4) secretion of a variety of anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, TGF-β) by activated joint macrophages; and (5) phagocytosis of previously activated apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages in the joint, altering the balance of cytokines secreted by these macrophages in such a way that pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is inhibited while anti-inflammatory cytokine secretion is enhanced. TABLE 24–1 Mechanisms causing down-modulation of the inflammatory response in gout. Thus, gout represents an excellent example of an acute inflammatory response initiated by a pro-inflammatory force. The response is acute, highly focused, and self-limited rather than self-sustaining and is associated with little tissue destruction in the acute phase. Flares of disease represent a recurrence of crystals in a pro-inflammatory form in the joints. Myelomonocytic cells and humoral factors (eg, cytokines and the complement and kinin cascades) are critical mediators of the acute syndrome. Clinical Manifestations A. Podagra and Episodic Oligoarticular Arthritis Podagra—severe inflammatory arthritis at the first metatarsophalangeal joint—is the most frequent manifestation of gout. Patients typically describe waking in the middle of the night with dramatic pain, redness, swelling, and warmth of the area. Flares of gout typically produce one of the most intense forms of inflammatory arthritis. The toes and, to a lesser extent, the midfoot, ankles and knees, are the most common sites for gout flares. Gout attacks frequently occur in circumstances that increase serum uric acid levels, such as metabolic stressors leading to increased DNA or adenosine triphosphate (ATP) turnover (eg, sepsis or surgery) or dehydration. Agents that reduce prostaglandin synthesis (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), reduce neutrophil migration into the joints (eg, colchicine), or decrease the activation of myelomonocytic cells (eg, corticosteroids) reduce the duration of a gouty flare. Gouty arthritis can be diagnosed by examining synovial fluid aspirated from an actively inflamed joint under a polarizing microscope. Monosodium urate crystals can be seen as negatively birefringent, needle-like structures that extend across the diameter of and are engulfed by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. B. Tophi Formation Firm, irregular, subcutaneous deposits of monosodium urate crystals may occur in patients with chronic gout and are referred to as tophi. A tophus most often forms along tendinous tissues on the extensor surfaces of joints and tendons, as well as on the outer helix of the ear. Such tophi may extrude chalky material, containing urate crystals, onto the skin surface that can be viewed for diagnostic purposes using polarized microscopy. C. Chronic Erosive Polyarthritis In some patients, the total body burden of uric acid increases greatly over years; deposits', 0.6147404611110687)\n",
      "(848, 'stemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis) is often remote and no longer recognizable once the unique disease phenotype becomes fully established and the diagnosis clear. Propagation of the disease typically occurs as a result of an autoimmune response that induces a self-amplifying cycle of damage. Autoimmune diseases are characteristically driven by “self-antigens” (eg, nucleosomes [composed of DNA and histones] in SLE) and can elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses. Conditions leading to the initiation of chronic autoimmune diseases occur rarely, but once a disease is established, flares are frequent. This circumstance probably reflects the abundant capacity of the immune system to “remember” previously encountered antigens and to respond to them with greater vigor when encountered again, even at lower concentrations (see Figure 24–1 ). Different tissues are affected in various diseases (eg, specific synovial joints in gout and rheumatoid arthritis; skin, joints, kidneys, serosal surfaces, nervous system, and blood cell lines in SLE). PATHOGENESIS OF INFLAMMATION The nature of tissue damage and joint injury is determined in part by the inflammatory and immune effector functions that predominate. In addition, the pathologic features of the chronic inflammatory disorders reflect the combination of inflammatory damage and the consequences of healing. ENDOTHELIAL ACTIVATION The recruitment and activation of specific subsets of inflammatory and immune cells are essential determinants of the pathologic features. In this regard, the role of regional blood vessel endothelium activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα], interleukin [IL]-1β) must be emphasized. Several cytokines induce the expression on endothelial cells of ligands for the adhesion-promoting receptors of inflammatory cells (integrins and selectins) and allow neutrophils and monocytes to adhere to the vessel wall in the inflamed area and migrate into the underlying tissues. CYTOKINES Distinct classes of immune effector function are activated depending on the pattern of cytokines that predominate during initiation of the inflammatory response. For example, some cytokines (eg, IL-12) produced by infected monocyte-macrophages skew the lymphocyte response toward T H 1 cells (which generate the T H 1 cytokines IL-2, interferon-γ, and TNFα) that are associated with activating macrophage killing functions and protecting against invading intracellular pathogens. In contrast, the presence of IL-4 during the initial response induces the differentiation of T H 2 lymphocytes, which generate T H 2 cytokines (eg, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10). These cytokines have their predominant function in activating B cells and generating antibodies. A new subset of helper T cells that develop in the presence of the cytokines TGF-γ and IL-6 has recently been described. These cells are termed T H 17 cells because of their characteristic secretion of IL-17. They appear to be critically involved in recruiting granulocytes, protecting against certain types of bacteria, and generating chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Although significant overlap exists, specific pathologic features tend to accompany the different cytokine patterns (eg, granulomas for T H 1 versus immune complex disease for T H 2). In addition, significant data point to an important role for type I interferons in inducing novel pathways of monocyte differentiation in patients with SLE that enhance responses to “self-antigens.” COMPLEMENT PATHWAY The classical complement pathway is activated when antibody binds to its specific antigen. Activation of the complement cascade induces inflammatory cell recruitment and activation (with all the consequences mentioned later), other features of the acute inflammatory response (eg, increased capillary permeability), and cellular damage mediated by terminal components of the complement cascade (ie, membrane attack complex). MYELOMONO', 0.6180493831634521)\n",
      "(95, 'portant consequence of inflammation is that the pH of the inflamed tissues is lowered, creating an inhospitable environment for the microbe. The increased blood flow to the area allows continued recruitment of inflammatory cells as well as the necessary components for tissue repair and recovery. When a microorganism enters host tissue, it activates circulating proteins including complement (see below) and induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. These mediators result in the increased vascular permeability and vasodilation characteristic of inflammation. For example, the anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a, produced by the activation of complement, stimulate the release of histamine from mast cells. Histamine dilates the blood vessels and further increases their permeability. Bradykinin is also released, increasing vascular permeability. Pro-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon-γ. These factors, singly or in combination, promote fever, produce local inflammatory signs, and trigger catabolic responses. During severe infection, a change in hepatic synthesis of proteins occurs, resulting in an increase in some proteins and a decrease in others. Most notable is the increase in acute-phase reactants , which include rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and various proteinase inhibitors. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), a nonspecific marker of inflammation, also increases, although in a slower fashion. A catabolic state is further augmented by simultaneous increases in levels of circulating cortisol, glucagon, catecholamines, and other hormones. Mild to moderate inflammatory responses serve important host defense functions. For example, elevated body temperature may inhibit viral replication. Inflammatory hyperemia and systemic neutrophilia optimize phagocyte delivery to sites of infection. Decreased availability of iron inhibits the growth of microbes such as Yersinia that require this element as a nutrient. However, when the inflammatory responses become extreme, extensive tissue damage can result, as in the case of sepsis. COMPLEMENT SYSTEM The complement system is composed of a series of plasma protein and cell membrane receptors that are important mediators of host defenses and inflammation ( Figure 4–4 ). Most of the biologically significant effects of the complement system are mediated by the third component (C3) and the terminal components (C5–9). These crucial proteins are activated through one of two mechanisms, termed the classic and alternative pathways. The classic pathway is activated by antigen–antibody complexes or antibody-coated particles, and the alternative pathway is activated by mechanisms independent of antibodies, usually by interaction with bacterial surface components. Both pathways form C3 convertase, which cleaves the C3 component of complement, a key protein common to both pathways. The two pathways then proceed in identical fashion to bind late-acting components to form a membrane attack complex (C5–9), which results in target cell lysis. FIGURE 4–4 Complement reaction sequence and infections associated with deficiency states. (Redrawn, with permission, from Detrick B. Immunology. In: Carroll KC et al, eds. Jawetz, Melnick, and Adelberg’s Medical Microbiology , 27th ed. McGraw-Hill, 2015.) Once activated, complement functions to enhance the antimicrobial defenses in several ways. Complement facilitates phagocytosis by serving as an opsonin , binding to invading microorganisms and making them susceptible to engulfment and destruction by neutrophils and macrophages. The complement-derived membrane attack complex inserts itself into the membrane of a target organism, leading to increased permeability and subsequent lysis of the cell. Complement also acts indirectly by producing substances that are chemotactic for white blood cells. Inherited disorders of complement are associated with an increased risk of bacterial', 0.623603679156522)\n"
